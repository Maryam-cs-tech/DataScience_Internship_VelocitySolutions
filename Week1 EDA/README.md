Difference between Buisness Analytics, Data Science and Machine Learning 
**Data Science** - Data Science is a field of study that uses a scientific approach to extract meaning and insights from both structured and unstructured data.It involves analyzing past or current data trends to make informed decisions.Data scientists explore various models, build and fine-tune hybrid approaches, and work to understand the empirical properties of these models.They also develop and use advanced tools such as RapidMiner, BigML, Weka, R capable of handling massive datasets efficiently.

**Buisness Analytics** - Enables you to take data from external and internal sources, prepare it, run queries on it and create dashboards to make informed business decisions.It also evaluates the impact of these decisions in the near future.

**Machine Learning** -  refers to a set of techniques that enable computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.It involves developing new individual models and focus is mainly on improving model accuracy, validating results, and contributing to the academic or research communityâ€”typically by publishing papers that present novel approaches or insights.
